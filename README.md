# natural-language-to-sql-chatbot-mtech-project
The aim of this project is to demonstrate how Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be used to interpret user queries  written in plain English and convert them into SQL queries to retrieve data from a structured database. The goal is to  simulate a simple question-answering chatbot that interacts with a student database.
